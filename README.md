explore_fastHTML Mission Statement


[FastHtml](https://fastht.ml/) with [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/), [HTMX](https://htmx.org/), [Datastar](https://data-star.dev/), all have workflows that can be challanging to understand if you have learned classic single page app. explore_fastHTML's mission is to list coding patterns from differnt sources and develop them so they can be quickly applied to a project.

### Links and code
Links get broken so all examples from other sites will be copied locally with an initial ref link. The example will be cut to the minimn needed to explain the process. The example will evolve over time and may have no resembelence to the original code. Ownership of the code is always considered public domain under MIT.

### Solution Ranking 0..9
Soluitons have ranking that prefers simplicity over complex, Python over JavaScript, short over long, encapselated vs inline. More than 1 example might exist.

## basic setup
Initally MonsterUI and tailwind is being used for styling but other methods will emerge. Assume this is needed.

```
python-fasthtml
MonsterUI
```
